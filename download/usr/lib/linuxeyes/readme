Hi,

Thanks for downloading LinxuEyes.
OK, here is how you use it.
  * the main program is in /usr/local/bin/linuxeyes 
  * /usr/lib/linuxeyes/eq is a folder with equalizer presets (LE06 formnat, you must import them)

Have fun.

Bus and sugestions: alex@papiu.uttgm.ro or linuxeyes@lug.orizont.net
Website: http://lug.orizont.net/~linuxeyes (thanks to lug mures, pitu)

btw, you may download some addons from LinuxEyes website. ;)
